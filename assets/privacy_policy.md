- **Communications:** Messages, maintenance requests, inspection reports, and support tickets.

## When We Share Information

- **With other users:** Landlords and property managers may access tenant contact details and rental records for property administration; tenants can view landlord contact information and rental details.
- **Service providers:** We share limited data with trusted providers (payment processors, cloud hosts, email services, analytics) who must protect the data and may only use it for authorized purposes.
- **Legal requests:** We disclose information when required by law, court order, or to protect rights and safety.
- **Business transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale, user data may be transferred; we will take steps to maintain required protections.
